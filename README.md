# Logic Systems Designs with Xilnix Vivado
 This repo contains all VHDL codes ,related macros and board configuration files to implement various combinational and sequential logic systems. Following list shows the some of the logic systems we built in this Repo.
 
<ul>
  <li> Adders </li>
  <li> Subtractors </li>
  <li> Decoders </li>
  <li> Encoders </li>
  <li> Multiplexers </li>
  <li> Counters </li>
  <li> Registers </li>
</ul>

<b> Final destination of this project is to design comprehenssive simple microprosessor which can be do basic operations of a processor. </b>
